- offer choice of tmux bar colors 
  - (easily tell what you're sshed into)
   - pass in via CLI with e.g. `--extra-vars "tmux-bar-color=orange foo=bar"`
   - persist somewhere in ~/ so you only have to specify it once
- build desktop environment for cloud-pairing over vino/vinagre
- vagrant file (easily build windows/osx guest os)
  - CLI and X versions
- ubuntu / centos agnosticism

# vim

- indent / unindent
- modifications to colorscheme
    - make bg transparent again
